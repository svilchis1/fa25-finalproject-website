          <h4>Insights</h4>
          <small><ul>
            <li>From 1970-1990, black men experience a significant drop in marriage rates. This is due to the fact that incarceration rates exploded, affecting black men the most. Sentencing laws and drug policies strictened, causing black men to be imprisoned at higher rates.</li>
            <li>Black men and black women marry at significantly lower rates due to economic status. They recieve lower wages compared to the rest of society, and lower wages directly correlates to lower marraige rates as studies show.</li>
            <li>From 1960-1970, marriage rates went up on average for men. This is because of post-war economic growth and higher wages. Men were now more able to support a family because of these factors, and in turn experienced higher marriage rates.</li>

          <h4>Insights</h4>
          <small><ul>
            <li>In the years 2001-2002, low income marriage rates increased, which is contradictory to the rest of the years. This is because of a year of increased economic stability experienced by low income families due to the introduction of stimulus programs.</li>
            <li>Marriage rates for low income people have decreased over the past 45 years due to the fact that economic stability has been increasingly difficult to obtain and the public's view on marriage has shifted towards agreeing that marriage is not a mandatory part of life.</li>
            <li>Marriage rates for low income families were stable from 2000-2005 due to the demographic plateau, so the proportion of married people was stabilized.</li>

          <h4>Insights</h4>
          <small><ul>
            <li>Men have lower marriage rates than women. One reason for this is the fact that there are less men than women in society. Women generally live longer than men, and this will cause marriage rate disparities, especially in older generations.</li>
            <li>Men are shown to consistently have around a 10% lower marriage rate than women. This can be because men are more likely to participate in sexual relationships without marrying than woman are.  This leads to higher marriage rates in women.</li>
            <li>A decrease in marriage for women from 1960-2012 can be the effect of the decrease of their social dependence. More women have entered the workforce and do not need to rely on men as much to maintain financial independence.</li>

          <h4>Insights</h4>
          <small><ul>
            <li>Couples who have lower incomes experience higher rates of divorce. This is because couples who struggle over basic needs tend to struggle over larger martial problems.</li>
            <li>Contrary to low income couples, high income couples experience financial stability, which in turn makes it easier to support a family and support each other in marriage.</li>
            <li>Middle income couples, while not as maritally stable as high income couples, still earn enough to keep their divorce rates at a somewhat low level compared to low income couples. This is because they are less affected<br>by extreme stressors such as economic instability as low income couples are.</li>

          <small><ul>
            <li>Marriage rates have been steadily decreasing since 1960</li>
            <li>From 1970-1990, there was a large drop in marriage rates due to economic insecurity and an increased interest in having children outside of marriage.</li>
            <li>Marriage rates stayed fairly constant compared to other years from 2000-2005. This is due to the fact that these years aligned with the gap in generations between baby boomers and echo boomers (baby boomers' children),<br>where echo boomers were in their mid to late teens and not quite at marriage age.</li>

          <h4>Insights</h4>
          <small><ul>
            <li>Individuals who attended some college but did not get a degree tend to have hgiher divorce rates than those who only obtained a high school diploma. This could be because they have some level of financial instability because they had to pay for college.</li>
            <li>Individuals who obtain a graduate degree experience lower divorce rates than those who have a bachelors degree because they often marry later in their life. This delay allows for emotional devlopment, increased wisdom, and correlates to increased communication skills among couples.</li>
            <li>In 1960, no matter your education level, divorce rates were extremely low compared to modern day. This is because marriage was an expected life path for all people, regardless of eduation level and social stigma against divorce was strong.</li>
